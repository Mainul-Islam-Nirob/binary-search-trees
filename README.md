# Balanced Binary Search Tree Assignment

## Overview

This is an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) involves implementing a **Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)**  in JavaScript. A balanced BST ensures that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of every node is not more than 1, optimizing search, insert, and delete operations to work in \(O(\log n)\) time.

The project includes essential functionalities like tree traversal, height and depth calculation, balance checking, and dynamic rebalancing.

## Features

- **Tree Construction**:

  - Build a balanced BST from an array of numbers.
  - Automatically sort the array and remove duplicates.
- **Node Operations**:

  - Insert and remove nodes while maintaining BST properties.
  - Search for a specific node by value.
- **Traversal Methods**:

  - **Level-Order Traversal** (Breadth-First Search).
  - **Inorder, Preorder, Postorder Traversals** (Depth-First Search).
- **Tree Analysis**:

  - Compute the height and depth of any node.
  - Check if the tree is balanced.
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**:

  - Rebalance an unbalanced tree to restore optimal structure.
